to reset or undo commits (providing the head number till which we want the reset)
git reset HEAD~2
git reset <hash code of the commit that we can get from using the git log>
git reset --hard <HEAD or Hash> (--hard also makes changes reset from the vs code as well)

git push origin main


to create local-repo
git init


to push locally created repo into the remote-repo (which was not cloned)
step 1: create a repo from github to get its link

step 2: to add the remote-repo as origin for further push, etc

git branch <branch name> or
git checkout -b  <branch name>


to switch the branch
git checkout <branch name>


to delete a branch (switch to other branch before deleting)

to compare branches (to compare the current branch to the specified branch)
git diff <branch name>

git merge <branch name>


to get the changes from remote-repo to the local-repo

git log
